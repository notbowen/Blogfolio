If you find this piece of text, you're a stalker bruh.

## Introduction

The saying "pride comes before a fall" has been one of the most cliche
scenarios which we wrote for our primary school essays. My tiny arsenal of
story protagonists -- Tom, Ben and Jerry have suffered this fate no less than 2 times each.

However, every time I wrote this story, I never really did grasp the meaning
of this saying. It seemed to have been repeated so many times that my brain
subconsciously blocked any mention of it. Did I learn anything from
repeatedly penning down their fate? Nope.

How did I find out? I screwed up.

## Rising Action

You are currently in the middle of your term, and all the
assignments have just been released. Wow, there's so much time left. Let's spend
each day relaxing on the bed and slowly tackling our assignments, one bit
at a time.

The pacing is on track, everything's fine. Even if you screw up, you're
confident that everything can be put back into place. You've fixed many
screwed-up submissions before, and this would just be like the others.
The previous semester ended with stellar grades and a perfect score, even
though you felt like you didn't do well. This semester shouldn't have any difference.

## Climax

Fast forward to the day your assignment is due, and there happens to be a quiz
on that day too. There were a number of tests to revise for, a load of assignments
to submit, and a pile of unfinished tasks chasing after your ass. There was simply
no time to do anything amid the chaos of unfinished tasks.

"It's ok", you tell yourself. You've had quite a bit of experience in this field,
the answers should be rather straightforward too. You open the quiz. The questions
don't seem that hard, most of them sort of make sense. You select the answers that
you think makes the most sense. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Out of time. Submit.

The browser slightly teases you, hiding your grade as it displays a status of "marking".
It's too late. The score has already been inserted into their database, making its way
to your final grade calculation. After panicking around and finally locating where to
find the score, your eyes are met with a `F`. A straight vertical line with 2 intersecting
, perpendicular, horizontal lines, equally spaced, staring right at your face. Two words
come straight to your mind: "I'm cooked"

## Falling Action

After 11 years of writing essays, most of which revolves around overconfidence, the full
weight of the phrase "pride comes before a fall" hits me. I had been too overconfident in
my abilities. I thought I hadn't need to study. I thought I could score decently.
I thought I was, frankly speaking, goated. I was not, and I never had been.

## Reflection

At the end of the day, we are all human. No one can simply score well without putting
in any form of hard work. All the hard work that I have been putting into studying concepts
in computing had paid off for the first semester, and I had been reaping its rewards ever since then.
It's about time for me to buck up, and start putting in effort into continuing that streak that
I had been on. It's about time for me to start putting in effort into anything that I do, be it
homework or taking notes in class. It's time for me to humble down and give my utmost.
It's time to start preparing and planning my time efficiently.

Polytechnic can be easy, so long as you invest enough of your time consistently.
有备无患, preparedness averts peril. Overprepare for your task at hand, provide enough
breathing space, and you'll perform relatively well, even in sub-optimal scenarios.
