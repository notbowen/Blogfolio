This page lists some of the projects that I've worked on
and feel quite proud of. A list of all the stuff I've done
can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/notbowen).

## Blogfolio

This site! Started work on this cuz I wanted to have a domain
back in 2023. It used to be a full on web server powered by
Rust and SurrealDB, but I switched to SSGs as it was a pain
in the ass to maintain.

Stuff I used:

- [Zola](https://getzola.org/) (Rust SSG)
- [Archie-Zola](https://www.getzola.org/themes/archie-zola/) (theme)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) (hosting)

## BB84 Numpy

Created this as part of a cryptography assignment. Wanted
to learn more about quantum cryptography and decided to
implement the [BB84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84)
quantum key distribution scheme using Python's amazing
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) library.

Stuff I used:

- [Python](https://python.org/) (duh)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) (for funny vector-quantum math)

## Canteen Queue Estimater

---

A project done for my secondary school for "crowd management".
Utilizes a fine tuned version of YoloV5 to count the number
of heads in a queue and sends the data to a locally hosted
web server for display.

Stuff we used:

- [Python](https://python.org/) (I love python)
- [YoloV5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) (for computer vision)
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) (for the physical hardware)
