I am a Year 2 student currently pursing a Diploma in
Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
I would consider myself an avid CTF player, though it’s
debatable as I am not as chronically online as the rest.

If I’m not busy playing CTFs, you can find me tinkering
with some random-ahh project that would barely help with
my portfolio all while bringing me joy and suffering
through the waterfall of error messages I get when compiling.

## CTFs

---

I mainly play the following categories (though I’m open to
trying others):

- `web` -  I think I’m kinda skilled. Emphasis on the think.
- `pwn` -  I kinda suck but I’m tryna improve.

Notable CTFs:

- GreyCTF 2024 (Finalist, Top 11th)
- TISC 2023 (Level 6 Completionist)
