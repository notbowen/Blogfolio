# About Me

Hi, I am a Year 2 student currently pursing a Diploma in Cybersecurity and
Digital Forensics at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I would consider myself an avid
CTF player, though it's debatable as I am not as chronically online as the rest.

If I'm not busy playing CTFs, you can find me tinkering with some random-ahh
project that would barely help with my portfolio all while bringing me joy
and suffering through the waterfall of error messages I get when compiling.

## CTFs

I mainly play these categories (though I'm open to trying others):

- `web` - I think I'm kinda skilled. Emphasis on the think.
- `pwn` - I kinda suck but I'm tryna improve.

## Projects

Here is a list of cool projects that I've done (or at least I think they're cool):

- [BB84 Numpy](https://github.com/notbowen/bb84-numpy) - Networked BB84 Quantum Key Distribution protocol written from scratch using Numpy and Sockets.
- [Canteen Queue Estimator](https://github.com/notbowen/CanteenQueueEstimater) - Developed a system that uses YOLOv5 and Flask to estimate and display the school's canteen queue timings.
- [SimpleOS](https://github.com/notbowen/SimpleOS) - Bare bones operating system written in C and Assembly that runs snake.
- [Rust Blog](https://github.com/notbowen/RustBlog) - Now-deprecated blog written in Rust and SurrealDB.
